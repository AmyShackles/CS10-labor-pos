# How to Contribute

First, thank you for your interest in helping us to further develop this project. We understand that there are a number of open source projects out there to choose from and we are humbled that you would choose to spend your time and energy on ours.

We understand that documentation can sometimes be difficult to understand and that reading other people's code can be confusing at times, so we would like to offer any assistance we can if you would like to understand any part of the codebase further.

### Did you find a bug?

- Please ensure that it has not already been reported in <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/CS10-labor-pos/issues">Issues</a>
- If there is no open issue addressing the problem, open a new [bug report](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report). Please include as much detail as possible so that we can try to resolve the issue.

### Did you write something to fix a bug?

- Open a new [pull request](pull_request_template.md)!

### Do you have an idea that you think belongs in the project?

- Feel free to submit a [feature request](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request). We're welcome to any and all suggestions and look forward to what other people can come up with!

## Linting / Formatting

This project uses Prettier and Black as their code formatters and Flake8 as the linter for the Django server. We would prefer that all contributions submitted to the repository follow those code formatting rules in order to ensure that the code is consistent throughout.
